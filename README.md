## Introduction:
Hi, I'm Lily, better known as Grunge Fox. I'm 20 years old girl from Poland with over 5 years <!--would be cool if it changes every year lol--> of experience with graphics design (including logos, banners, posters, and photo editing).  

I'm also hoping to be software developer in the future and make apps with beautiful but easy to use UI/UX :3
